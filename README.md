Have you ever just felt pretty bored. You want to play some intense game yet something simple. Well I have just the game for you my friend, play Turtle Crossing..
This simple and seemingly easy game only operates with a single key, the up arrow.
All you got to do is move your turtle forward and avoid the cars crossing the road. Seems simple right, but trust me, it gets exponentially harder.
I bet you $0.00 that you will never make it to level 15 without some cheat.

*Please Remember to Take a Screen Shot if you Make it to Level 15 cuz the Highscore Doesn't save..
